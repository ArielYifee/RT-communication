# RT-communication

This is my first embedded project, it is communicated between two different MCU's by UART protocol.

By pressing buttons at the first MCU (Texas Instruments MSP430F5529), it turns one of the led on the board and sends a signal (UART) to the second MCU (Mbed LPC1768) turn on its led and show the signal on the screen.
